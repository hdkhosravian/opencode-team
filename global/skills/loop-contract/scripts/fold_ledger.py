fold_ledger.py — join ledger + verdicts into a report, and act as the completion gate.

Deterministic. stdlib only. This script is the reason "done" is a fact rather than a
claim: the agent cannot declare completion, it can only make this exit 0.

Exit codes:
    0  every row has a terminal verdict and the report was written
    1  integrity failure (unknown / duplicate / non-terminal / evidence-less rows)
    2  bad input

Usage:
